The included files define the different elements using functions that compute a result by simulating a logic gate. 
For instance  And3() a1(a,b, carryin) creates a gate called a1 that will be true when a,b, and carryin are all true. 

Unfortunately, not all of the dependencies and libraries referenced are included or currently available.
